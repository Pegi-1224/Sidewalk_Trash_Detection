# Trash Detection with YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN

This project explores object detection for trash and litter using two popular deep learning models: **YOLOv8** and **Faster R-CNN**. The goal is to train models capable of identifying trash in various outdoor environments using both real-world and synthetic datasets.

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets

### 1. [Original RoboFlow Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/tacotoyolo/only-taco-background0234v2)
A publicly available dataset focused on trash objects in natural scenes. Used as a baseline for initial experiments.

### 2. [Custom-Collected Dataset (Real-World)](https://virginiatech-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/peiying_vt_edu/EbFd8kc6-RtNhXUVzUyC8VcBBRAZdP8oWDWbcJG-fUbMgw?e=U8dWvA)
A collection of images manually captured and annotated around campus, with a focus on real-world sidewalk and grass areas.

### 3. [AI-Generated + Original Dataset](https://virginiatech-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/peiying_vt_edu/EXrg9gBaYn5Fhl7zPfV0TroBIc5a6dOk80mOlEyccyaIuQ?e=Ux7Gi9)
This dataset combines real photos with synthetic images generated using generative AI tools to improve generalization and robustness.
